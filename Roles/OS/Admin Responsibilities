Administrators have a vital role in the organization. 
Their main task is to keep all the projects in all the Basecamp (BC) accounts up-to-date and to ensure that the people involved 
in the projects are engaged, and informed so that the projects can run smoothly and the deadlines are met.

RULE OF THUMB: 
1. There are multiple basecamp accounts (new_os, secual, ancar, storyteller, etc). Under these basecamp accounts are
multiple projects. Your admin duties are required in all the projects and basecamp accounts. You need to make sure you have access
to all.
2. Every time you complete a task, you are required to comment "TASK CLOSE"
