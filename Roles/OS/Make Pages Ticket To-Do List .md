HOW TO MAKE PAGES TICKET TO-DO LIST

Purpose: To create a to-do list for each page target of the software development. 
These to-dos are mainly for GUI (user-interface) projects. 


1)	The input is where the page targets are extracted. This can be from a sitemap (see image below) or from a list in a text 
format. Sitemaps and text lists are added in Inboxes as files

2)	The inputs are sometimes written in Japanese. In this case, request our translators available to convert the Japanese text 
in English. 


3)	Once you have the page target list, you may now create a ticket to-do list. 
 
              a)	You need to follow this format on the List Title: Page Name #Tickets #GUI

              b)	Note that you have to create a to-do on each page target of the development.

              c)	If you are unsure of which basecamp account you need to create the to-do, find the Needle. For instance, 
                  in the screenshot example, Ancar is mentioned. Thus, we create the to-do in Ancar basecamp account.

              d)	There are several GUI projects where you need to create the to-do list. If you are unsure which specific 
                  project it is, you can always create the to-do list in the Inbox of that basecamp account. 
                  (Note: All BC accounts have their own Inbox). You can move it to the right project later once you have verified.
