One of the task required from Administrator is creating a timeline (or in basecamp, EVENT) for the Milestones and to-dos created
in the projects. The purpose is to give an overview of all tasks pending on a period just by clicking the Calendar of the basecamp
account instead of going through each project.

Before creating an Event, Admin must have the following information:
1) Milestone and to-dos

2) Start Date (you can assume the start date is when the Milestone and to-do was posted)
3) Due Date (if not indicated, you can assume a due date of 5-7 days from the start date)
4) Assigned person for the milestone/to-do (if the milestone/to-do is not unassigned, assign it to the Internal Director first)
5) URL Link of the Milestone

Once you all have the information, you can now create an Event for that particular Milestone
1)  Click the Events tab on a Project

3)  In the subject of the event, insert the Milestone
    In the optional note, insert the URL link of the Milestone
    Under the When section, Click the "last multiple days or repeats"  and insert the start and the end date
    Include all the people assigned to the "Email to" section

4)  Save the changes. Re-click the event and go to the "discuss this event" section to go to the comment page

5) Insert the URL link of the Milestone in the comment and click save

6) Go back to the Milestone and insert the URL link of the Event you created

Rule of Thumb: You need to create Events for all Milestones in all projects found in all basecamp accounts
