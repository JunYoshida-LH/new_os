### How to:

1. Go to project Calendar
2. Click on any project from the Projects list
3. Add a "New event"
               
               > Click on any date estimated for the start of the event
               > Rename the event exactly the same as the to-do list
               > Copy the URL of the to-do list and add it as an optional note.
               > Set estimated end date for tasks that last for multiple days
               > Email to the person that needs to be notified
               > Click "Add this event".

4. Discuss the event
                     > Click on the newly created event and hit Discuss this event...
                     > Post the event URL as comment
                     > Save changes.
