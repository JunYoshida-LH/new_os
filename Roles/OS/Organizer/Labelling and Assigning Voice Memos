As an Admin-Organizer, part of your daily routine is to check new voice memos uploaded.
These voice memos are normally added in the Global Inbox. However, it can also be in other inboxes (ancar, secual, and storyteller).
It can also be attached as a discussion/comment in to-do list, to-dos, etc.

It is an Organizer's job to find these new voice memos and label them then assign them to the right person. 


A. Labelling Voice Memos
    - Label ENGLISH for English audio files; JAPANESE for japanese audio files
    - Label "for transcription" if it requires transcription; "no need to transcribe" if it is not required to be transcribed
    - Label the audio file #tasking if it is a task
    
B. Assigning Voice Memos
    - if the voice memo needs to be transcribed, assign it to the transcriptor. Use the "discuss this file" tab and update our 
      transcriptors
    - if the voice memo don't require transcription and a specific person was mentioned, find the person. You may use the 
    "discuss this file tab" and update the person assigned. 
    - if the voice memo don't require transcription and is a task, click the "discuss this file" tab, 
      and update the Internal Director
