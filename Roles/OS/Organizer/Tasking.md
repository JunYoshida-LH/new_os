You need to Google "Tasking" to understand the concept of tasking. We are using this term to express the operations like making lots of tasks assigning basically from client side to us o may be our client requests or internal messages it has tasking and we need to divide these messages in to the tasks and may be some messages which is telling two or more things in one message so we need to divide it in to people or in to tasks and assigning them to each of the members. 

Specially if can't find proper person by your knowledge/information you have and you need to assign the task to the director first and directors will assign the task to some one. We need to avoid all the tasks not assigned to anyone so this tasking including this kind of flow in the rules of our Basecamp.
