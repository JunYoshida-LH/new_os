We use Basecamp for Ticket Repository.

## Conventions: 
1. Link branch and tickets whenever possible.
2. Post the ticket url to commit on the comments part. 
3. Set the due date of the tickets. our Progress Managers ( who does only this task ) will require this due date from you. 
4. It is important to set due date on each tasks/to-do by clicking your name on the right side , calendar will display click the date when you can complete the task assignment.
5. Estimate the time of the given task. provide the time/duration to complete each task/to-do by posting a comment (discuss this file tab) on the to-do. This time estimation will be used as reference to calculate the cost when you send your invoice for payment purposes.
6. If task/to-do is completed, do not mark the to-do as completed. Use # string for tagging in order to chain the task. Sometimes we use tags, in order for the workflow to proceed to the next step. When the developer completes the task/to-do, the developer will have place a tag #to_be_tested or #releasing or whatever is appropriate for the next step. The tagging string should follow the form to start with #Create commit patch when you complete a todo. 
  The most important rule is to not close (put a check mark) the task/to-do once the developer is finished with his task/to-do.   The developer needs to tag or assign to the tester and comment "for review/testing".
