# Ubiquitous Capture
### Opereations Purpose
  “Task Capturing as Basecamp To Dos”  
  Objective - “Capture-Process-Organize-Do”

dependency: [ubiquitous capture from GTD](http://www.43folders.com/topics/ubiquitouscapture)

Basically, one of the revelations of GTD is the very simple  mandate to write everything down.  “UBIQUITOUS CAPTURE” means Capture all your thoughts on reliable system (or digitally).
the major benefit is "you can forget it" and cleanup your brains working memory for creative work. don’t let them float around in your head.

and it is strongly similar to one another concept of programmers community, "[Ticket Driven](../Ticket Driven.md)". 

And the biggest benefit from of this is forget -> concentrate on the creative work. this point. 

Ours, is "Team GTD". so it's, "team Ubiquitous Catpure". same beneftis and very similar rules expected. 

In our organization “UBIQUITOUS CAPTURE” is one task management system simply capturing the task by creating Basecamp Todos.  which means to “capture” any task, or topics of discussions as fast as possible.
