# judgement process, on administrator work force 

## the facts numbers

1. the work hour they provided for Monday and Tuesday, is  about 5
2. 10 work hours as total. 2.5-5 hours as average. 
3. required work load (work hours needed ) is estimated to be 12 hours / day. 
4. survive rate is 33%. In the list of 5 people who joined the trial, 2 people survived. in the facts, the average for 5 years, it is 1/3. so we should belive this would be very average. 
5. 2 people survivors has provided about 3-4 hours / day as total of 2. it is the average hours counted for 7 days. 
6. survivors provided 1.5-2 hours / person.


## plan

1. 12 - 3 = 9 work hours required to be added.
2. 9 / 1.5 ( or 2 ) = 4〜6 people who really works ( survivors ) to be added.
3. (4 〜 6) * 3(1/3 remains) = 12 - 18 trials required.

we need 12-18 people as trial, but we should first try 8 people. but there would be confustion if we have too many at once. so every 5 days we should hire 3 people and using 4 weeks ( one month ) we should try 12 people.
