This is another recording about the status management for the transcriptions I think this one is lost somewhere, I made one recording. First, we have five… three four five transcription status, levels, rules and it means that you should see the ah, yeah…the first one is on transcriptions tag label and it means you… that when you come to the work then you have to label if you find which you can do the transcription then you have to name it ah… when you start transcription you have to label it with “on transcription” and by this you can see which files are available for you and if it’s shows “on transcription” is locked to someone, someone is working on that already so it’s not for you and you can find other ones yeah. The second one is the status label, is that done…d-o-n-e, done, and it means done, transcription is done and you have to label it after you complete the transcription on that. And this is the basic one. And the second one is the language levels, English and Japanese because you, I think, are English speakers and you guys are coming to the sites and if the transcription or voice memos are in Japanese, then you have to label it “Japanese” and if it’s English then label it “English.” I know yeah, you should. And it means that we have some Japanese transcriptors too and they come to the site and they try to find the ones they need to transcribe and then it’s done I mean simply they can find the Japanese ones only yeah. And also at their site they will name it “English,’ label it “English” like when it’s uploaded and they listen to it and it’s English so label it “English” so you can find the English version only by filtering, easier. And yeah… two way transcription status, this one is another one and to be transcribed and no transcription you need to label this one is couple. Sometime some of the transcriptions on head apart over the voice memos you don’t need…it’s talking it’s says you don’t need to transcribe. And this one will be operated, will be handled by admins not transcriptors. And maybe no need to transcribe and will be given to someone. Yeah usually the tasks assign to someone it’s kinda urgent ones, can’t wait to be transcribed so that’s marked. So that’s the rules.  So basically you don’t need to transcribe to Japanese this and what you need to do is… to be transcribed no labels ones and English ones and not on transcriptions things, no “on transcription” things so that’s for you.

Ok ah…this is a note for the transcription thing and...when you capture “to do” for the transcripted content, please be careful you have a day must be completed list, transcribed inbox to the list is already there. Once you have completed a to-do list, or a list in the to-do list it’s hidden, not displayed in the to-do list parts and it’s in the completed to dos part you can find the completed to do list of transcribed inbox as indicated in the image below. And open the completed to dos and make another to-do there so there avoiding the duplicated name transcribed in the Inbox to the list could be made everytime you make the to-do list so this is the notes, additional notes about transcribed Inbox operations.

Ok I made a voice memo because it is a bit longer than that and no time to chat, typing. So here the situation is that basically this is an application that bring by sounds triggered by beacons, in a second version. In the first version, the mp3 files was stored in the old application package. And in the newer version now we are developing version 2. This one has the downloading features functionalities to, from the Java mp3 hosted httpd and we are downloading and it’s done. But now when you look at the code, it’s saving files into, in web view control you can find functionalities to download the mp3 into the …into…into…into…somewhere…it’s called yeah…in data manager class that’s lock been IOS, yeah user default manager and saved object with method code to the mp3 files downloaded object and I think that’s the NS data file. Ok so, and maybe dictionary lap and mp3 files and they are the binary files and it should be played ah this files other ones should be played. I’m not sure how, yeah but the program is that the player we used the mp3 audio player we using the version 1 is not the one we can use maybe or maybe we can. Now in the version 1 if you look at the web view control parts, ah it’s trying to load the file, file, file means not the NS data but the file could be the end point that APH can load and we have to I think save the file…the NS data into that file once and we should load it from the path somewhere. And I’m not sure how to find the path of the files but anyway what we need to do is save it to the file and load it as the file not the NS data directory, so that’s the program.
