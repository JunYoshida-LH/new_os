Ticket, is basically an alias of Todo. 


Like handling all the topics and problems as tickets and all the tickets must have the responsibilities and all the thing must have deadlines and people must check other people’s tasks done OK and also if he can’t do the task by the deadline, he must keep up the responsibility and ask their colleagues to do it or may be we need to talk to the client.

Ticket Driven concept has brought into the world of programmers relatively describe the project development lifecycle. 

It also aims removing obstacles during development process to help the team get their work done. At the same time,  complacency is being observed, and drive the team to complete work on time and with good quality. This method is to help our organization solve some of the complex roadblocks and impediments.

By integrating the various tools, we can manage information at one place. Communication is focused on the issue and using this concept it makes the communication easier. 

Don’t depend on email, collaborate on work with an issue, keep everyone up to date on progress and identify dependencies. Display all critical team information on a highly visible writeboard, so nothing gets missed, this allows the team to see where they are, and the work necessary to finish on time. This also measures team efficiency  average lead time, the average time cost from a task being put into  “Done” and team capacity, average total work in progress the average task number with the state not being “Done”

In our organization a very easy to understand example, we can identify the states in the workflow as  “In Progress”, and “Done”.  “Backlog”, “In Progress”, and “Completed”. The difference is that ,we will have a relatively fixed backlog, and we have a fixed time frame to finish everything in the backlog. Bugs are also issues which the team members can use to associate source to backlog.

We basically manage issues by the tickets ranging from development to maintenance or manage tasks with tickets by dividing them. 

We use Basecamp tickets to handle all issues, When issues arises this  help in simplifying the developer’s task for applying the solution . responsibility is presented to clarify the situation when needed . In some cases where a developer cannot fix the issues pertaining to the task given, he should commit accountability and be responsible to initiate delegation of task to the other person or colleagues, suggest resolution . Please be reminded. since from the client point of view, once they throw the tasks to the team, they already starts the counting of the time you take to get those done. So the time that the tasks are pending in the basecamp will be also consider as part of the time you spend on finishing those task.

This  concept can be a communicative guideline that will provide developers an understanding of how to apply Ticket driven and it’s best practices.
