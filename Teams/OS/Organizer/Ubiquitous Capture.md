  “Task Capturing as Basecamp To Dos”  
  Objective - “Capture-Process-Organize-Do”

dependency: ubiquitous capture from GTD>

Basically, one of the revelations of GTD is the very simple  mandate to write everything down.  “UBIQUITOUS CAPTURE” means Capture all your thoughts on paper (or digitally) — don’t let them float around in your head, where they will surface at inappropriate times, stress you out and be forgotten when they are needed. If you have an idea write it down, right now, before you forget. It’s simple, low tech and very effective. This is a well-known principle in the collection phase of the GTD workflow. If done well, it helps to generate useful complete and correct input for GTD system. 

And the biggest benefit from of this is forget -> concentrate on the creative work. this point. 

In our organization “UBIQUITOUS CAPTURE” is one task management system simply capturing the task by creating Basecamp To Do’s,  which means to “capture” any task, or topics of discussions as FAST TO DOs or  in either case “open loop” as we calls them for later processing , because the list is just in order of capture. You will also not have things broken into context, which means you will be constantly sorting through different types of actions that you can’t actually act upon right now.
