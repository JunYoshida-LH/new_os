This is a tips to passion to do a kayaking management liquidating from the one platform and doing Micro tasking. We are giving some way by doing many things out of our platforms I work tools and a work management tools.

 We usually use base camp and flow dock for the members Constant members but Micro asking people usually do not come to our tools usually. But we want to give some chats to the members because they are in our tools and only hiring people. But your technical Director support you to Bring people. For that purpose that is the functionality in flow dock to give one time a URL link access. It's little bit unsecured but it's very powerful. If the people come and talk there we will have real-time chat. We recommend you to use this, the way to do this is if you open the link in our platform in our flow dock settings page and you can find one time URL. Please learn about that by checking the details and flow dock manuals.
