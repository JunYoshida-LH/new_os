The purpose of microtasking is hiring people in a smaller scale for smaller tasks assigned to cloud sourcing people. 
+ People can do the tasks and they don't need to understand the full context of the task. It must be simple and executable.
+ We can get the parallel progress. For example, if you have 100 tasks and 30 of these can possibly executed in few days, then 30 parts will be done in few days. This is 10 times faster than the normal development. Microtasking can achieve 100% results of the tasks.

As written in the first tasks, in the "projects", you have to do the template work.

There's another template and you have to find it like the like hiring template base and creative as well. You will also make the basecamp template for this microtask. After creating the template, you will need to move the To-do and once you moved all the To-dos, then you will need to complete the hiring template. Only then you will complete the hiring template tasks project for the microtasking.

What you need to do first is make the job posting text on the templates. We have a job posting template in the base. You will need to copy from the template source and make a text document as the base. Then, you need to replace some parts on to the contents on what you need to develop. That is how you make a complete job posting text. 


it's so easy to do most of the tasks. 90% of the tasks are very typical and like routine.

Basically, if you are assigned to one project base only, then you can reuse the job posting text of microhiring, 
the part changes, is only "Tasks" part.

This is an example illustration for the manual process.

Normally, there are few tasks given to the candidates. As first task , in this example, we have the makemycompanyaccount. Some microtasking tasks include payment confirmation or verification processing or posting of a dummy job. Basically, the amount of the tasks will be like four hours, or less than that. You will have to move the task there.

The next important point is you put the scope of the tasks, which is describing the scope on what is needed to be done. Know that in job posting hiring, we basically describe as something in between the next step and the after hiring process. You have to ask about the status, this is an important duty for you as the microtasking manager. For example and in order for you to provide us estimation, you can create a new job post then provide the details to us. If it is not acceptable to us, the scope of the task will then be clarified. 

also you have to make not only freelancers ( as in screen capture ) but make other platforms. follow todos.
