1)	The input is where the page targets are extracted. This can be from a sitemap (see image below) or from a list in a text 
format. Sitemaps and text lists are added in Inboxes as files

2)	The inputs are sometimes written in Japanese. In this case, request our translators available to convert the Japanese text 
in English. 

3)	Once you have the page target list, you may now create a ticket to-do list. 
 
a)	You need to follow this format on the List Title: Page Name #Tickets #GUI
b)	Note that you have to create a to-do List ( not todo )  on each page target of the development.
