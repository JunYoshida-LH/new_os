we are encouraging that meetings (which are inherently discouraged due to certain circumstances) must be captured in Basecamp. To clarify, meetings within the projects are not prohibited, but because of the fact that we are thousands of miles from each other, meetings are considered at the least of priorities within the teams/projects. Moreover, there are certain rules which must be followed in Base Camp before conducting/facilitating a meeting, to wit;

The meeting's AGENDA must be clearly recognized before we have meetins.  Hence, the topics to be discussed and the URL's of the conversations must be captured in BC and presented. The outline of subjects to be tackled must also be presented, it is like making a request with justification.

These will show that the requested meeting is of great importance and the same must be prioritized. It will also serve as a basis for the conduct of said meeting.
