dependencies: CoC, Naming Conventions ( programming ) 

if you don’t know make sure you learn and google around  CoC of rails. 

A naming convention is a convention for naming Objects. 

Precise and consistent terminology helps the developers to automate things, without any automation codes. 

they use naming conventions to omit some tasks, and writing codes. 

We adapts naming conception powerd management, to whole part of our workflow and document management

e.g. Naming the same for linking two objects. (NameTheSame)
1. Todo List and corresponding Milestone in BC must be named ( perfectly same ). 

### benefits

1. All members, or newly assigned administrators or testers, can find  the deadline, material image files, instruciont to execute the todo, without asking anyone. 
2. people can find the objects super fast. by typing out “gf” in basecamp, and paste the title of todo, then you can find the right there, all the related and required things. milestones of the todo, documents for the todos, manuals for the todos, etc. it makes your work tasks hours 10-40% less. this is recorded number. Finding Things is major modern wokrder time consupmtion, and it is max 60% of your work time in micro way.


### Conventions
The following guidelines/criteria must be put into consideration when naming conventions related to Basecamp matters:

1. put the purpose in the titile. 
purpose is "what is expefted to be achieved after execution". 
2. NameTheSame. 
Do not put the general title/words for the name of the tasks and to-do titles.  
3. do not put person's name. 
4. do not use general title
do never name them like ‘tasks, to-dos, Kouji’s tasks’. 
5. same name, for the linking channels. 
e.g. flowdock and basecamp channels should be completely same. completely, means, "computers can detect it is the same string.".  if your project has "Manualization" project, and if you create flowdock channle corresponding to it, then , 

Bad cases:
manual, manualize, manualizations
Good Case: 
Manualization
