Google Calendar
=====
From now on, along with Besecamp's todo, Google calendar will be incorporated in Operation estimate and operation management. Because of this, everyone needs to share their Google Calendar ID。


Project schedule that requires speed
-----
Everybody is fragmentarily doing their jobs/tasks by style of distribution. However, in projects that requires speed, the following occurs when planning on when to finish a project。
1. The director gathers a group with certain skills.
2. The director checks everyone's status 
  - In a certain time, people who are free during 3pm on Monday
  - Those who are free on days after Monday and such
3. After that, plan on assigning tasks to these people

With these above, it would be possible to assign people and quickie finish the project efficiently.
This is the reason for implementation.

Regarding time
-----
- As usual, it’s relaxing because it is a system where anybody can do tasks on their free time
- In case anybody is unable to make it on such time, changes are possible to some extent

In exchange for that to some extent, although lack of work doesn't occur, we do hire a lot of people in regards to a task. 
Everybody does not need to worry about working on their full-time job or other freelancing roles as the contract permits it。


Informing availability
-----
### In case of long-term tasks
At present, we require schedule 2-3 in advance, but if schedule is wished to be set for long-term in weeks or so, as to what time the task wanted to be assigned, it will be handled as follows。
 1. Request by name
 2. Must hold on to such schedule from the day permission is granted

In such cases, it will be handled this way。

### Informing availability
Regarding informing availability, a form is filled up around 1-3days ever since, but proposed this to be handled as follows。

1. It will be done in Google drive.
2. After that, inform that it is finished

### Google account
For the sake of simplicity of the availability of the report, we will be multiplied by the "teaser" from everyone against New OS Google account. 
Procedure to apply a "teaser" is as follows.

1. Make an event. Schedule an event in Google Calendar.
2. Invitation occurs
3. Send the invitation to the address new.exclamations@gmail.com. (this account is to manage microtasking and as a sign of everyone's participation)
4. The manual's URL should be posted, as below。

When the Secual personnel dept. that holds administration and other tasks receives the invitation, it will be displayed on their side. From that, everyone's availability can be viewed with only a single calendar.

E-mail address that should receive the invitation:
new.exclamations@gmail.com 

Operation progress report
-----
Setting operation report (availability) aside, operation progress report can be roughly generated。

### Report content
Precise details can be easily known in Basecamp's to do, so the content it is alright to make mistakes. Please generate the report as follows。
- Estimate performance around last week
- No need to do task report. Just state how many hours spent on each days worked

### Why the report can be roughly generated
- Detailed parts are already listed in Basecamp's to do and Activity history, its decided that these are more reliable。
- Matching of operation report for charges and wages will not occur。

### Purpose
This is for everyone's time operation estimation, which will benefit both sides. Next proposal will be as follows。
- In case there is not that much work performed, the reason for it must be thought of. (Those with prior appointment/tasks and not in   schedule are exempted).
- Cases like those that were scheduled yet nothing to do might appear

As one of the hiring side, in order for us to decide whether to hire more people for the same role for tasks that takes time, we compiled these materials。
