# Moving items between projects and copying items
dependency: basecamp functions. check basecamp help for move and copy files. 

Go to the item you want to move: You can move discussions, files, to-do lists, text documents, and forwarded emails. Single events can be moved into new projects, but recurring events can’t. You’re not able to move comments or files attached to comments. Admins can move anything; non-admins can only move the items they’ve created, follow this demo

Click “Move,” on the right
You can move an individual to-do by clicking on the to-do item, then clicking Move. You can choose the project and the list it moves to. Make sure the item’s new home has an open to-do list, otherwise it can’t be moved.

Because our work style is strongly depending on the concepts of “work **flow**” and we basically do moving things around the projects. by moving things to the next steps in the workflow, the things are being completed to the outbox.
