A naming convention is a convention for naming Objects. 

Precise and consistent terminology helps the developers and other people concerned in the project to get into the right track.

in progrmaming methodologies we use naming conventions to omit some tasks, and writing codes. if you don’t know make sure you learn and google around  CoC of rails. 

adapting this concept to whole part of our workflow convetions. 
ex. naming the same, as todo-list and corresponding milestone same ( perfectly same ),then you and all members, or newly assigned administrators or testers, can see the deadline, of a Todo included in the Todolist, by seeing the milestone due end. 
in this case naming-the-same helps people to find the objects super fast. by typing out “gf” in basecamp, and paste the title of todo, then you can find the right one. and also you can find the chat rooms comments if you name the same them. it makes your work tasks hours 10-30% less. this is recorded number.



The following guidelines/criteria must be put into consideration when naming conventions related to Basecamp matters:
Do not put the general title/words for the name of the tasks and to-do titles.  
Avoid naming like ‘tasks, to-dos, Kouji’s tasks, and such kinds’.
 For the to-do list : state the purpose - what is achieved when all of the to-do’s inside are done.  That should be in the title string of the to-do list.
Don’t name ‘to-do list thing’ in the to-do list coz it’s already understood and that others are also considered to-do lists.

For the Calendar Events title naming convention, please see Calendar Synchronization Manual.
