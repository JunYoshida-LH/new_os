Please be reminded that even we are using other online payment gateway such as Paypal, Upwork , Freelancers.com or Payoneer we are still adopting Elance payment system particularly in releasing payment schedule. These process has been integrated in our hiring system procedure in contracting freelancers . 

These are the following guidelines:

Fixed Job:

 Once a job is awarded, you and your Client define and agree upon Milestones, and funds are then placed into Escrow. You can quickly and safely begin working knowing that payment is secure and will be released once work is completed, and Clients are protected knowing their funds are securely held in Escrow and will only be released to you when work is delivered and accepted.

Steps

Clients Pay Only for Results: only release funds when work is approved. 
Jump-Start Jobs: Freelancers can immediately begin working knowing that funds are readily available.
Per hour job record your task on the timesheet using google spreadsheet with basecamp url link
Under your basecamp todo's put your time estimation as comment how many hours will you complete the task.
At the end of the week submit your timesheet following the required information given on the sample below

Please note: Escrow is only available for Fixed Price jobs. Escrow is not available for Hourly jobs. 

Once a Milestone has been completed, the Freelancer will submit a Status Report. The Status Report will serve as a proforma invoice and will reference the completed Milestone. If we are satisfied with the work, we have 15 days to release the funds before the payment is marked as "Overdue". If you we not satisfied with the services from Freelancer or if they did not meet the requirements of the Job Agreement, we do not approve the release of any Milestones.

Other contracts outside freelancer platform other than Elance.
