# Flow and Stock 

## Stock
The information that is reerences many times, but not heavily changed. it’s master ( to transactional data ) in our Workflow Objects. 

It is a general background information about the specific project for reading purposes. Stock concept doesn’t have a time reference.

### granularity
bigger. higher level information. 
### examples
 like project level, meta-project level, conventional level, etc.

## Flow
refers to the to dos information.Information about a single task to clarify and bring to execution. 
- It has a time reference e.g. gives the values over a period of time.
### granularity
smaller. lower level information
### examples
1. Conversations in chat tools,
2. comments
3. Todos
4. Todo-lists

Should store the Objects on right place following this principle.
