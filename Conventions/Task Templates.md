# Project Templates

- [ ] to be revised
 
we use project template for role base work. 
convention: if there is project template related to the task you are assigned, you should run the template  for sure. and do things there in the created project. it would be short term project. but we should make small projects and archive it small.

e.g. if you are an hiring manager and assigned a Todo to hire someone, then you must create a project from Project Template of Hiring ${Role} (for ${Project}) 

## the benefit of Project Template
1. we can follow the common and the best way of doing those typical tasks

this is the best way. for the most of project templates, have the consultants, and specialist for that tasks. 
e.g. in the “Hiring” template, it is design to have more and more people to post to many of hiring platforms, and also there is a todos to negotiate with trial tasks, this is following our company main product. newjit concept. to eliminate until we start hiring people, and can find good developer ( this is the one of the most important assets of us ) to repeat by having more people trial. this trial cost elimination makes more payments to good developers after the ones are  found. but if you don’t follow the rules to “making project from template if one exist” you will make demerits to the team about it. if you are an specialist of hiring, you are not allowed to skip creating project from templates. 
2. of course it omits our hands to make each of todos
